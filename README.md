These are some stats based on the equipment polls in Play Meter (available on archive.org) cross-referenced with the games listed on the Killer List of Video Games (https://www.arcade-museum.com/)

Based on photos of the arcade machine's controls available on KLOV, or elsewhere if KLOV didn't have suitable photos, I categorized each as L, R, S, or NA.

L = Left movement. Joystick or other movement controls are on the left. This includes games like Asteroids where the rotation is on the left and thrust is on the right, even though you can argue thrust is part of movement.

R = Right movement. Joystick or other movement controls are on the right. 

S = Symmetrical. Joystick with trigger, joystick with no buttons (Pac-Man), or joystick with mirrored buttons on either side (Sinistar)

NA = Not Applicable. Controls where it wouldn't have made sense to place movement on one side. Shooting games with gun controls or driving games with steering wheels, for example.

I tried to include the top ten from the equipment poll, even though Play Meter would sometimes list more than ten. Some issues that were missing could be partially filled in from following issues where they listed the prior rankings of games.
